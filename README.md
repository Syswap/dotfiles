#dotfiles

This repository is available for ArchLinux and other distribution, if you just want to use my dotfiles, you have to install these packages to use it : 

feh, i3, nautilus, nerds font, hack fonts, bitmap fonts, kitty, polybar and lxappearance, picom, zsh

Lxappearance is here just for set themes and icons.

For ArchLinux, there is 2 type of files. The files marked with UEFI are made for UEFI system (os-prober is already in theses files in if you make a dual boot with Windows)

You have to configure the rest of ArchLinux, like : 

<ol>
    <li>Hostname</li>
    <li>Localhost</li>
    <li>Users (Personnal and root)</li>
</ol>

Note : 
The installation file named "archinstall_V3-574TG.sh" is for my laptop
